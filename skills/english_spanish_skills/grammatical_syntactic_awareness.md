# Grammatical and Syntactic Awareness Skill

## Overview
This skill provides deep understanding of how sentence structures differ between English and Spanish, enabling proper restructuring during translation while maintaining grammatical correctness and natural flow in both languages.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Structural Differences Between English and Spanish

#### Word Order Patterns

**Basic Declarative Sentences:**
- **English:** Rigid SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)
  - "I eat apples" ✓
  - "Eat I apples" ✗
- **Spanish:** Flexible, allows variations
  - "Yo como manzanas" (SVO) ✓
  - "Como manzanas" (VO, subject implied) ✓
  - "Manzanas como" (OV, for emphasis) ✓

**Question Formation:**
- **English:** Requires auxiliary verbs or inversion
  - "Do you speak Spanish?" (auxiliary do)
  - "Are you coming?" (verb inversion)
- **Spanish:** Can maintain word order with intonation
  - "¿Hablas español?" (maintain order, use intonation)
  - "¿Tú hablas español?" (optional subject, rising intonation)
  - "¿Hablas tú español?" (optional inversion)

**Negation:**
- **English:** "not" after auxiliary or BE verb
  - "I do not speak" / "I don't speak"
  - "She is not here" / "She isn't here"
- **Spanish:** "no" directly before main verb
  - "No hablo" (I don't speak)
  - "Ella no está aquí" (She is not here)

#### Pro-Drop Characteristic

**Spanish is Pro-Drop Language:**
Subject pronouns can be omitted when clear from verb conjugation:
- "Hablo español" = "I speak Spanish" (yo implicit)
- "Comes mucho" = "You eat a lot" (tú implicit)
- "Vamos al cine" = "We go to the cinema" (nosotros implicit)

**When to include pronouns:**
- Emphasis: "YO hablo español" (I speak Spanish, emphasizing "I")
- Disambiguation: "Él habla" vs "Ella habla" (when gender matters)
- Contrast: "Yo trabajo, tú descansas" (I work, you rest)
- Clarity: After conjunction or in complex sentences

**English Requires Subjects:**
- "Is raining" ✗
- "It is raining" ✓

### 2. Verb System Differences

#### Aspect and Tense Mapping

**Present Progressive:**
- **English:** Frequently used for ongoing actions
  - "I am studying" (right now)
  - "I am working" (currently)
- **Spanish:** Simple present often sufficient
  - "Estudio" (can mean "I study" or "I am studying")
  - "Estoy estudiando" (explicitly ongoing, more emphatic)

**Present Perfect:**
- **English:** Have/has + past participle
  - "I have eaten"
- **Spanish:** Haber + past participle
  - "He comido"
- **Usage difference:**
  - English: Recent past with present relevance
  - Spanish (Spain): Recent past, still relevant
  - Spanish (Latin America): Often use preterite instead

**Past Tenses:**

**English Simple Past:**
"I ate" / "I went" / "I saw"
→ Could map to either:

**Spanish Preterite (completed actions):**
- "Comí" (I ate - completed action)
- "Fui" (I went - completed action)
- "Vi" (I saw - completed action)

**OR Spanish Imperfect (ongoing/habitual past):**
- "Comía" (I was eating / I used to eat)
- "Iba" (I was going / I used to go)
- "Veía" (I was seeing / I used to see)

**Decision Criteria:**
- One-time completed action → Preterite
- Ongoing past action → Imperfect
- Habitual past action → Imperfect
- Background/description → Imperfect
- Sequence of events → Preterite

**Example Analysis:**
"Yesterday I went to the store. The weather was nice. I bought milk and went home."
- "went to the store" → "fui" (preterite, completed)
- "was nice" → "estaba" (imperfect, description)
- "bought" → "compré" (preterite, completed)
- "went home" → "fui" (preterite, completed)

#### Subjunctive Mood

**English:** Largely lost, remnants in formal contexts
- "I suggest that he go" (subjunctive "go")
- "If I were rich" (subjunctive "were")
- Mostly uses indicative: "I want that he goes" ✗ → "I want him to go" ✓

**Spanish:** Active and essential
- After expressions of: doubt, emotion, desire, impersonal expressions
- "Quiero que vayas" (I want you to go)
- "Es importante que estudies" (It's important that you study)
- "Dudo que venga" (I doubt that he'll come)

**Translation Trigger Patterns:**

English → Spanish Subjunctive:
1. **Want/wish + person + infinitive**
   - "I want you to go" → "Quiero que vayas"
   
2. **It is + adjective + that**
   - "It's important that you study" → "Es importante que estudies"
   
3. **Expressions of doubt**
   - "I doubt he'll come" → "Dudo que venga"
   
4. **After 'hope' (in Spanish)**
   - "I hope you're well" → "Espero que estés bien"

5. **Purpose clauses (so that)**
   - "I'll explain so that you understand" → "Explicaré para que entiendas"

#### Infinitive vs. Conjugated Verb

**English:** Infinitive after many verbs
- "I want to go"
- "She needs to study"
- "They like to dance"

**Spanish:** Two patterns depending on subject change

**Same Subject → Infinitive:**
- "I want to go" → "Quiero ir" (same person wants and goes)
- "She needs to study" → "Necesita estudiar"

**Different Subject → Que + Subjunctive:**
- "I want you to go" → "Quiero que vayas" (I want, you go - different subjects)
- "She needs him to study" → "Necesita que estudie"

### 3. Noun Phrase Structure

#### Adjective Placement

**English:** Adjectives before nouns (mostly)
- "the red car"
- "a beautiful house"
- "an intelligent student"

**Spanish:** Adjectives typically after nouns
- "el coche rojo" (the car red)
- "una casa hermosa" (a house beautiful)
- "un estudiante inteligente" (a student intelligent)

**Exceptions - Adjectives Before Nouns:**

**Inherent characteristics:**
- "una gran ciudad" (a great city)
- "un buen hombre" (a good man)
- "un mal día" (a bad day)

**Quantifiers:**
- "mucho dinero" (much money)
- "poco tiempo" (little time)
- "varios libros" (several books)

**Ordinal numbers:**
- "el primer día" (the first day)
- "la segunda vez" (the second time)

**Possessives:**
- "mi coche" (my car)
- "tu casa" (your house)

**Meaning changes with position:**
- "un gran hombre" (a great man - important)
- "un hombre grande" (a big man - physically large)
- "mi viejo amigo" (my old friend - long-time)
- "mi amigo viejo" (my old friend - elderly)

#### Compound Adjectives

**English:** Hyphenated adjectives before noun
- "a well-known author"
- "a long-term solution"
- "a state-of-the-art facility"

**Spanish:** Various constructions
- "un autor bien conocido" (adjective + adverb)
- "una solución a largo plazo" (prepositional phrase)
- "una instalación de última generación" (prepositional phrase)

#### Possession

**English:** Apostrophe 's or possessive adjectives
- "John's car" (possessive 's)
- "my car" (possessive adjective)
- "the car of John" (less common)

**Spanish:** De + possessor, or possessive adjectives
- "el coche de Juan" (the car of Juan)
- "mi coche" (my car)
- "el coche de Juan" is standard; possessive 's doesn't exist

**Possessive Adjectives vs Pronouns:**
- Adjectives (before noun): mi, tu, su, nuestro, vuestro, su
  - "mi casa" (my house)
- Pronouns (after noun, with article): mío, tuyo, suyo, nuestro, vuestro, suyo
  - "el coche mío" (the car of mine) - emphatic
  - "el coche es mío" (the car is mine) - after ser

### 4. Article Usage

#### Definite Article Requirements

**Spanish uses definite articles more frequently:**

**With abstract nouns:**
- English: "Life is beautiful"
- Spanish: "La vida es hermosa"

**With general statements:**
- English: "Dogs are loyal"
- Spanish: "Los perros son leales"

**With body parts (instead of possessive):**
- English: "I hurt my hand"
- Spanish: "Me duele la mano" (reflexive + article, not possessive)

**With languages (sometimes):**
- English: "I speak Spanish"
- Spanish: "Hablo español" (no article) or "Hablo el español" (with article, less common)
- But: "El español es difícil" (Spanish is difficult - subject)

**With days of week:**
- English: "I work on Monday"
- Spanish: "Trabajo el lunes" (article required)

**With titles (when talking about someone):**
- English: "Doctor Smith is here"
- Spanish: "El doctor Smith está aquí"
- Exception: Direct address: "Buenos días, doctor Smith"

#### Article Omission in Spanish

**After 'ser' with professions:**
- English: "He is a doctor"
- Spanish: "Es médico" (no article)
- Exception: Modified noun: "Es un médico excelente"

**With 'otro':**
- English: "another day"
- Spanish: "otro día" (no article)

**In negative sentences:**
- English: "I don't have a car"
- Spanish: "No tengo coche" (often no article)

### 5. Preposition Differences

#### Prepositional Phrase Patterns

**Time Expressions:**
- English: "at 3 o'clock" → Spanish: "a las tres"
- English: "in the morning" → Spanish: "por la mañana"
- English: "on Monday" → Spanish: "el lunes"

**Location:**
- English: "at home" → Spanish: "en casa"
- English: "in Spain" → Spanish: "en España"
- English: "at the office" → Spanish: "en la oficina"

**Personal 'A':**
Spanish requires 'a' before direct objects that are people:
- "I see Maria" → "Veo a María" (personal a required)
- "I see the car" → "Veo el coche" (no personal a)
- "I love my mother" → "Amo a mi madre"

**Exceptions:**
- After tener: "Tengo tres hermanos" (no personal a)
- With indefinite people: "Busco un médico" (seeking any doctor)

#### Verb + Preposition Combinations

**English prepositions don't always map directly:**

**"To think about":**
- English: "I think about you"
- Spanish: "Pienso en ti" (think IN you)

**"To wait for":**
- English: "I wait for the bus"
- Spanish: "Espero el autobús" (no preposition needed)

**"To look for":**
- English: "I look for my keys"
- Spanish: "Busco mis llaves" (no preposition needed)

**"To listen to":**
- English: "I listen to music"
- Spanish: "Escucho música" (no preposition needed)

**"To depend on":**
- English: "It depends on you"
- Spanish: "Depende de ti" (depend OF you)

### 6. Pronoun System Differences

#### Object Pronoun Placement

**English:** After verb
- "I see him"
- "She told me"
- "They bought it"

**Spanish:** Before conjugated verb
- "Lo veo" (Him I-see)
- "Me dijo" (Me she-told)
- "Lo compraron" (It they-bought)

**Exceptions:**
**Attached to infinitives:**
- "Quiero verlo" (I want to see him)
- Or: "Lo quiero ver" (both acceptable)

**Attached to gerunds:**
- "Estoy viéndolo" (I am seeing him)
- Or: "Lo estoy viendo" (both acceptable)

**Attached to affirmative commands:**
- "¡Cómelo!" (Eat it!)
- But negative: "¡No lo comas!" (Don't eat it - before verb)

#### Double Object Pronouns

**English:** Both after verb
- "I give it to him" (direct object + indirect object)

**Spanish:** Both before verb, indirect before direct
- "Se lo doy" (To-him it I-give)
- Note: "le" becomes "se" before lo/la/los/las

**Order:** Indirect Object + Direct Object + Verb
- RID: Reflexive → Indirect → Direct

**Examples:**
- "I buy it for you" → "Te lo compro" (to-you it I-buy)
- "She shows them to me" → "Me los muestra" (to-me them she-shows)
- "We explain it to him" → "Se lo explicamos" (to-him it we-explain)

#### Reflexive Pronouns

**English:** Uses reflexive only when necessary
- "I wash myself" (clear reflexive)
- "I wash" (intransitive, no object)

**Spanish:** Extensive reflexive verb system
- "Me lavo" (I wash myself)
- "Me levanto" (I get up - literally: I raise myself)
- "Me duermo" (I fall asleep - literally: I sleep myself)
- "Se fue" (He left - literally: He went himself)

**Many Spanish reflexive verbs are not reflexive in English:**
- levantarse (to get up, not "to raise oneself")
- sentarse (to sit down, not "to seat oneself")
- vestirse (to get dressed, not "to dress oneself")
- acostarse (to go to bed, not "to lay oneself down")

### 7. Passive Voice Differences

#### English Passive Voice

**Common structure:** BE + past participle
- "The book was written by García Márquez"
- "The house is being painted"
- "The problem will be solved"

#### Spanish Passive Alternatives

**True Passive (less common):**
- "El libro fue escrito por García Márquez"
- Similar to English structure but less frequently used

**Reflexive Passive (more common):**
- "Se habla español aquí" (Spanish is spoken here - literally: oneself speaks)
- "Se venden casas" (Houses are sold - literally: oneself sells)
- Used when agent (doer) is not important

**Active Voice with Indefinite Subject:**
- "Dicen que..." (They say that... = It is said that...)
- "Hablan español aquí" (They speak Spanish here = Spanish is spoken here)

**Translation Strategy:**
English passive → Spanish reflexive passive or active:
- "Spanish is spoken here" → "Se habla español aquí" (reflexive)
- "The house was sold" → "Se vendió la casa" (reflexive)
- "It is said that..." → "Se dice que..." (reflexive)

### 8. Comparison Structures

#### Comparative Forms

**English:**
- Short adjectives: adjective + -er + than
  - "bigger than", "smarter than"
- Long adjectives: more + adjective + than
  - "more beautiful than", "more intelligent than"

**Spanish:**
- Consistent pattern: más/menos + adjective + que
  - "más grande que" (bigger than)
  - "más inteligente que" (more intelligent than)
  - "menos caro que" (less expensive than)

**Irregular Comparatives:**
- English: good → better, bad → worse
- Spanish: bueno → mejor, malo → peor

#### Superlative Forms

**English:**
- "the biggest", "the most beautiful"
- "the best", "the worst"

**Spanish:**
- el/la/los/las + más/menos + adjective
  - "el más grande" (the biggest)
  - "la más hermosa" (the most beautiful)
- el/la + mejor/peor
  - "el mejor" (the best)
  - "el peor" (the worst)

**Absolute Superlative (-ísimo):**
- Spanish has additional form for "very/extremely"
  - "grandísimo" (extremely big)
  - "hermosísima" (extremely beautiful)
  - "riquísimo" (extremely delicious/rich)

### 9. Conditional and Hypothetical Structures

#### If-Then Constructions

**Present Real Conditionals:**
- English: "If + present, will + verb"
  - "If it rains, I will stay home"
- Spanish: "Si + present, future"
  - "Si llueve, me quedaré en casa"

**Past Counterfactuals:**
- English: "If + past perfect, would have + past participle"
  - "If I had known, I would have come"
- Spanish: "Si + past subjunctive, conditional perfect"
  - "Si hubiera sabido, habría venido"

**Present Counterfactuals:**
- English: "If + past, would + verb"
  - "If I were rich, I would travel"
- Spanish: "Si + imperfect subjunctive, conditional"
  - "Si fuera rico, viajaría"

### 10. Relative Clauses

#### Relative Pronouns

**English:**
- who, whom, whose, which, that
- Can sometimes be omitted: "The book (that) I read"

**Spanish:**
- que (most common), quien/quienes, el cual/la cual, cuyo
- Generally cannot be omitted: "El libro que leí"

**Usage Patterns:**

**'Que' (most versatile):**
- People: "La mujer que vi" (The woman that I saw)
- Things: "El libro que compré" (The book that I bought)

**'Quien/Quienes' (people, after prepositions):**
- "La persona con quien hablé" (The person with whom I spoke)

**'El cual/La cual' (formal, clarity):**
- "La casa en la cual vivo" (The house in which I live)

**'Cuyo/Cuya' (possessive):**
- "El autor cuyo libro leí" (The author whose book I read)

### 11. Gerunds and Infinitives

#### After Prepositions

**English:** Can use gerund (-ing)
- "before leaving" 
- "after eating"
- "without thinking"

**Spanish:** Uses infinitive
- "antes de salir" (before to-leave)
- "después de comer" (after to-eat)
- "sin pensar" (without to-think)

#### As Subject

**English:** Gerund or infinitive
- "Swimming is fun" (gerund)
- "To swim is fun" (infinitive, more formal)

**Spanish:** Infinitive
- "Nadar es divertido" (To-swim is fun)

#### Progressive Forms

**English:** BE + gerund
- "I am eating"

**Spanish:** Estar + gerund (-ando/-iendo)
- "Estoy comiendo" (I am eating)

**Spanish gerund only for progressive, not other uses:**
- English: "I like swimming" (gerund as object)
- Spanish: "Me gusta nadar" (infinitive, not gerund)

### 12. Question Formation

#### Yes/No Questions

**English:** Requires inversion or auxiliary
- "Are you coming?"
- "Do you speak Spanish?"
- "Is she here?"

**Spanish:** Can use intonation alone
- "¿Vienes?" (Are you coming?)
- "¿Hablas español?" (Do you speak Spanish?)
- "¿Está ella aquí?" (Is she here?)

#### Wh-Questions

**English:** Question word + auxiliary + subject + verb
- "Where do you live?"
- "What does she want?"
- "When did they arrive?"

**Spanish:** Question word + verb (subject often implied or follows)
- "¿Dónde vives?" (Where live-you?)
- "¿Qué quiere?" (What wants-she?)
- "¿Cuándo llegaron?" (When arrived-they?)

**Question Words:**
- qué (what)
- quién/quiénes (who)
- dónde (where)
- cuándo (when)
- por qué (why)
- cómo (how)
- cuál/cuáles (which)
- cuánto/cuánta (how much)
- cuántos/cuántas (how many)

### 13. Negation Patterns

#### English Double Negative = Positive
- "I don't know nothing" = incorrect or means "I know something"
- Must say: "I don't know anything"

#### Spanish Double Negative = Negative
- "No sé nada" (Not I-know nothing = I don't know anything)
- "Nunca veo a nadie" (Never I-see to nobody = I never see anyone)
- "No tengo nada" (Not I-have nothing = I don't have anything)

**Spanish Negative Words:**
- no (no, not)
- nada (nothing)
- nadie (nobody)
- nunca/jamás (never)
- ninguno/ninguna (none, not any)
- tampoco (neither, not either)
- ni (nor, not even)

**Patterns:**
- No + verb + negative word: "No veo nada"
- Negative word + verb (no "no" needed): "Nunca veo películas"

## Application in Translation

### Step 1: Parse Source Structure
- Identify sentence type (declarative, interrogative, imperative)
- Locate subject, verb, objects, modifiers
- Note tense, aspect, mood
- Identify subordinate clauses

### Step 2: Map to Target Structure
- Determine appropriate Spanish word order
- Select correct verb form (tense, mood)
- Position adjectives correctly
- Apply gender/number agreement
- Insert appropriate articles and prepositions

### Step 3: Apply Structural Transformations
- Convert English passives to Spanish alternatives
- Adjust pronoun placement
- Restructure noun phrases
- Modify relative clauses as needed

### Step 4: Verify Grammaticality
- Check all agreement (gender, number, person)
- Verify verb conjugations
- Confirm article usage
- Validate prepositions
- Ensure pronoun order (RID rule)

### Step 5: Natural Flow Check
- Read aloud mentally
- Confirm sounds natural to native speaker
- Verify word order feels right
- Check no unnatural literal translations

## Common Translation Pitfalls

### 1. Literal Word Order
❌ "Yo tengo un rojo coche" (English order)
✅ "Tengo un coche rojo" (Spanish order)

### 2. Unnecessary Pronouns
❌ "Yo hablo español y yo vivo en España" (redundant yo)
✅ "Hablo español y vivo en España"

### 3. Wrong Preposition
❌ "Pienso sobre ti" (literal "think about")
✅ "Pienso en ti" (correct Spanish preposition)

### 4. Passive Voice Overuse
❌ "Español es hablado aquí" (unnatural passive)
✅ "Se habla español aquí" (reflexive passive)

### 5. Missing Personal 'A'
❌ "Veo María" (missing personal a)
✅ "Veo a María"

### 6. Gerund Misuse
❌ "Me gusta nadando" (English gerund pattern)
✅ "Me gusta nadar" (Spanish uses infinitive)

### 7. Article Confusion
❌ "Vida es hermosa" (missing article)
✅ "La vida es hermosa"

### 8. Possessive Structure
❌ "El coche de John's" (mixing patterns)
✅ "El coche de John"

## Best Practices

1. **Analyze before translating**: Understand full structure first
2. **Don't translate word-by-word**: Restructure for target language
3. **Check agreement systematically**: Gender, number, person
4. **Verify prepositions**: They rarely translate directly
5. **Position pronouns correctly**: Before conjugated verbs (generally)
6. **Use reflexive passive**: Instead of English passive voice
7. **Mind the subjunctive**: Recognize trigger patterns
8. **Respect Spanish flexibility**: Multiple valid structures often exist
9. **Test naturalness**: Would native speaker say it this way?
10. **Maintain meaning over form**: Structure serves meaning, not vice versa
